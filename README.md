These libraries provides a family of combinators to define webservices and automatically generate the documentation and client-side querying functions for each endpoint.

In order to minimize the dependencies depending on your needs, we provide these features under different packages.

- `servant`, which contains everything you need to *declare* a webservice API.
- `servant-server`, which lets you *implement* an HTTP server with handlers for each endpoint of an API.
- `servant-client`, which lets you derive automatically Haskell functions that let you query each endpoint of a `servant` webservice.
- `servant-docs`, which lets you generate API docs for your webservice.
- `servant-jquery`, which lets you derive Javascript functions (based on jquery) to query your API's endpoints, in the same spirit as `servant-client`.

## Getting started

We've written a [Getting Started](http://haskell-servant.github.io/getting-started/) guide that introduces the core types and features of servant. After this article, you should be able to write your first servant webservices, learning the rest from the haddocks' examples.
